🚀 Jarvis: AI-Powered Research Acceleration Framework
Executive Summary
Jarvis is an autonomous multi-agent framework that transforms a single research idea into a comprehensive, actionable plan in minutes, not weeks. By simulating a collaborative team of 10 specialized AI agents, this system automates the entire initial R&D lifecycle—from ideation and feasibility analysis to final reporting. It dramatically reduces manual effort, mitigates initial planning risks, and empowers researchers to focus on innovation and execution.

Key Outcomes & Value Proposition
This project demonstrates the ability to architect and deploy sophisticated AI systems that deliver tangible value.

⚡️ Drastic Efficiency Gains: Automates hundreds of hours of manual work typically required for initial research, literature review, and planning.

🎯 High-Quality, Data-Driven Insights: Leverages a team of AI specialists to provide a 360-degree analysis, ensuring that research plans are well-vetted, innovative, and grounded in current trends.

📊 End-to-End Automation: Manages the entire workflow autonomously, culminating in the automatic generation of multi-format reports (HTML, JSON, Markdown) ready for review and distribution.

💡 De-risked Innovation: Identifies potential challenges, research gaps, and feasibility issues early in the process, allowing for smarter, more strategic decision-making.

How It Works: The Automated Collaboration Flow
The framework operates as a sequential pipeline where each AI agent builds upon the work of the previous one, creating a coherent and progressively refined output.

Getting Started
1. Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

git clone [https://github.com/your-repo/jarvis-research-system.git](https://github.com/your-repo/jarvis-research-system.git)
cd jarvis-research-system
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. API Key Configuration (⭐Crucial⭐)
Open main.py and set your Google Gemini API key.

# main.py
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"  # <-- Paste your API key here

3. Running the System
Execute the main script from your terminal.

python main.py

You will be prompted to enter a research idea. The system will take over from there, providing real-time updates and opening the final HTML report in your browser upon completion.
